# Key Features of This Code:
# GPIO-based Step and Direction Control: Uses the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins to send step pulses and control the motorâ€™s direction.
# User Input: Allows the user to start, stop, adjust speed, and change direction of the conveyor belt.
# Speed Control: Speed can be adjusted in m/s by changing the pulse interval.
# Direction Control: Allows the user to change the direction of the conveyor.
# How It Works:
# STEP Pin: The Raspberry Pi sends a HIGH pulse to the STEP pin, which causes the motor to take a step. The interval between pulses controls the motor speed.
# DIR Pin: The DIR pin controls the direction of the motor rotation. HIGH means one direction (e.g., forward), and LOW means the opposite direction (e.g., backward).
# The program continuously sends step pulses at the calculated interval (pulse_interval) to make the motor run.
# Adjusting Speed:
# The speed is controlled by adjusting the time interval between pulses. A higher speed means a shorter interval, and a lower speed means a longer interval.
# The formula used for calculating pulse interval (self.pulse_interval = 1 / (self.speed * 100)) is just a simple example. You may need to adjust this based on your specific motor and system setup.

# Control Keys:
# s: Start the conveyor belt and ask for speed.
# e: Stop the conveyor belt.
# +: Increase speed by 0.25 m/s.
# -: Decrease speed by 0.25 m/s.
# r: Reverse or toggle the direction (Clockwise / Counter-clockwise).
# q: Quit the system and clean up resources
